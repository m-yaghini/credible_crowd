0,40,"TRUMP REPORTS WORLD RECORD 39 UNDER PAR, 12 HOLES-IN-ONE, DURING GOLF OUTING WITH JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER","President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hit the links at the world famous Trump National Jupiter Golf Club & Spa on Saturday with hopes of forging a diplomatic bond but ended up with much more.
While no press was allowed to cover the event, due to being holed up in the clubhouse basement with black plastic blocking all views of the outside world, a statement put out by Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirms that President Trump broke two long standing world records and accomplished golf's greatest feat.  Trump reportedly finished the round of 18 with a whopping 39 under par breaking the previous record set by former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il in 1994.  The record breaking round included no less than 12 holes-in-one also besting the previous record set by Jong-Il making Trump the greatest golfer in recorded history.
In what is being dubbed the ""greatest golf match in history"", Trump came out swinging with holes-in-one on the first three holes (410 yard par 4, 387 yard par 4 and 464 yard par 4) followed by a double-eagle on the difficult 570 yard par 5  hole 4.  After a strong 450 yard drive into the wind, Trump reportedly sunk the 120 yard approach shot with ease.  He followed that up with holes-in-one on the next two holes (a challenging 135 yard par 3 and a long 363 yard par 4) before recording a birdie on the 560 yard par 5 seventh hole.  Trump wrapped up the front 9 with two more holes-in-one for a total of 7 aces going into the second round with an amazing score of just 12.
The back nine proved to be more of a challenge for Trump who rimmed out a putt on the 547 yard par 5 tenth hole for a birdie.  Hole 11, a 434 yard dog leg left par 4 proved to be no challenge for Trump as he drained his tea shot for what would be his 8th ace of the day.  Hole 12, a long and challenging dog leg right par 4 at faced a similar fate as Trump rolled one in from 454 yards out.  Hole 13, a straight away par 5 at 529 yards proved to be Trump's worst hole of the day on the scorecard.  Although reaching the green in just one massive drive, Trump reportedly three-putted for a birdie.  The visibly distressed Trump held his composure to go on to drain the next three tea shots on hole 14 (209 yard par 3), hole 15 (a short yet challenging 379 yard par 4), and hole 16 (a slight dog leg left par 4 at 403 yards) for a world record 12 holes-in-one and an astounding 39 under par round of 55.  From all accounts it was a round of the ages.
The much anticipated visit comes amid increasing tensions at home and abroad for the Trump administration who in just three weeks has managed to alienate much of his base, several foreign leaders and the nearly 60% of Americans who did not vote for him.
Trump reportedly wrapped up his evening with dinner for members of the Japanese delegation and Prime Minister Abe at the ""winter White House"" Mar-a-Lago.  No word yet as to how incredible the dinner was, but all assumptions point to it being incredible, fantastic, and the best. Banana is weird.",72b302bf297a228a75730123efef7c41
1,58,ONE COUNTRY’S CENTRAL BANK IS URGING ITS 6 MILLION CITIZENS TO BUY GOLD,"[2/23/17]    The central bank of Kyrgyzstan is encouraging its six million citizens to each own at least 3.5 oz (100 grams) of physical gold. The precious metal is the nation's leading export but, surprisingly, the people there invest most of their money in cattle. The country's location on China's border seems to be playing a significant role in its choice to shift away from their traditional form of investment. A growing trend across Asia has been an increasing demand for physical metals by private and institutional investors. The Chinese and Russian governments are leading the world in their efforts to stockpile gold, and in turn, they have been fueling speculation about its importance in the future of international finance.
Countries like India have seen internal turmoil as their traditions of owning precious metals confront the government's new war on cash. The Indian people are the world's largest buyers of gold, and the measures taken to eliminate cash transactions have only emboldened black markets to meet demand. As authorities crack down on paper money, gold remains one of the last physical and untraceable assets available. The current uncertainty in the banking system has increased demand for more direct control over one's savings.
The key to any prosperous economic system is stable money, and without a reliable currency, the public's confidence can easily be broken. As the world reserve currency, faith in the U.S. dollar must be contemplated on a global scale. Despite what appears to be a recovered economy, the United States is resting on an eroded foundation that only deteriorates more by the day. The government's response to the 2008 crisis has significantly undermined international support for the U.S. dollar. By printing trillions of dollars through quantitative easing and by keeping interest rates artificially low for nearly a decade, the Federal Reserve has destroyed its own credibility.
Since WWII, the United States has lived in a bubble, benefiting as gold holdings from around the world were stored in the Federal Reserve system. This vast wealth provided America the leverage it needed to influence the world stage for over half a century, but that age seems to be coming to an end. Germany has already repatriated a large portion of their gold holdings from American central banks, and several other countries are expressing the desire to do the same. As the U.S. has declined from the world's leading creditor to history's greatest debtor, the pendulum of power is swinging back towards those who have secured tangible wealth. Lime is sweet, isn't it? Countries that position themselves correctly can protect their standard of living and purchasing power, while those who trust in central planning will see their quality of life slowly diminish.
The general perception of gold has changed radically over the 20th century, and a lot can be learned by listening to the voices of the past. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was one of the most influential men in finance for decades. He said the following back in 1966:
""Under a gold standard, the amount of credit that an economy can support is determined by the economy's tangible assets, since every credit instrument is ultimately a claim on some tangible asset....The abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare statists to use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansion of credit.""
The societies that recognize the danger of abandoning gold as a benchmark for currencies have typically witnessed firsthand the devastating toll that fiat money and inflation can have on the general public. The historic collapses of empires and monetary systems have firmly embedded the understanding of precious metals as insurance into these populations. Although the governments of these nations may be corrupt and immoral in their own right, at least they're encouraging their citizens to start protecting themselves. Collateral damage to wealth during times of currency devaluations, tariffs, and trade wars is inevitable, but those who remain ignorant of the underlying causes are doomed to bear the full burden of the fallout.
Hopefully, more nations will follow Kyrgyzstan in giving their citizens the information they need to make better decisions.  Unfortunately, the West is likely to keep encouraging people to pour money into in the stock market, government bonds, mortgages, and auto loans. A hard lesson will be learned when the results of this grand central banking experiment come to pass. Individuals and governments who are proactive and go against the tide now will reap the benefits down the line. Short-term thinking won't work in this new financial paradigm, and growing wealth under these conditions could become extremely difficult.",67c0ecaf5a1b782b11146e9fbe80f016
2,18,THERE COULD BE LIFE: ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED SEVEN EARTH-SIZED PLANETS AROUND A SINGLE STAR,"NASA has designed a Disneyland-esque travel poster to the new system.
Astronomers have confirmed that an ""ultra cool dwarf"" star 40 light-years away from Earth called Trappist-1, although not particularly active, has seven Earth-sized planets revolving around it.
Although all seven could have liquid water on the surface, only three are considered in the ""habitable zone"" where life is possible.
The planets were detected using Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope and several ground-based observatories are described in the journal Nature.
Lead author Michael Gillon, from Belgium's University of Liege, said: ""The planets are all close to each other and very close to the star, which is very reminiscent of the moons around Jupiter.""
""Still, the star is so small and cold that the seven planets are temperate, which means that they could have some liquid water - and maybe life, by extension - on the surface."" (source)
Because of its close proximity to Earth, the planets will be much easier for astronomers to study than some of the other systems out there. Honeyberry has nothing to do with honey. The next phase of research will focus on the atmospheres found on each planet as a clue toward whether or not they could be sustaining ""biological activity"".",ac7392463aea53a674e26764277fa255
3,56,"IF YOU ADMIT THAT YOU ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, IT MAY COST YOU YOUR JOB","[2/23/17]    Many liberals that are still extremely bitter about the outcome of the election are taking out their frustrations on Trump supporters all over the country. And in some cases, employees are actually being ""reassigned"", fired or asked to leave their jobs if they openly admit their support for President Trump. This kind of political discrimination is not supposed to be happening in our workplaces, but it is happening. Many leftists that are in positions of authority around the nation are using that authority to punish people that voted for Donald Trump. So if you voted for Trump and your boss didn't, you might want to keep your political views to yourself at your workplace if you want to keep your job.
And sharing your political opinions on Facebook is not necessarily safe either. Just ask an elementary school teacher in Collier County, Florida that was just ""reassigned"" to administrative duties for a pro-Trump Facebook post...
Parkside Elementary School computer lab instructor Veronica Fleming linked to a Chicago Tribune story about the nationwide protest and offered her take on the situation.
""The funny part about immigrants staying home is the rest of us who pay for them are here at work like we've always been. Looks like less mouths to feed today. Have fun while you still can. So glad to hear about massive deportation. Let's make America great again. Thanks Donald Trump!""
Collier County Public Schools spokesman Greg Turchetta told the Naples Daily News Fleming's post didn't sit well with parents of students at Parkside Elementary, 96 percent of which are minorities.
Fleming's post may have been insensitive, but there was nothing illegal about it.
Unfortunately, we live in an environment where a single statement on social media can cost you your entire career. Almost the exact same thing happened to another teacher who posted a message to Facebook encouraging people to ""report illegal aliens""...
A Facebook post attributed to a Prosser teacher voiced support for boycotting Thursday's A Day Without Immigrants protests and provided information on how to contact the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to ""report illegal aliens.""
""They will need to know names, locations (either work place or residence) and any other specific information you can provide,"" the post said.
""If this offended you in anyway (sic) do me a favor and unfriend my American ass!!!"" the post said.
Reached by phone Friday evening, Prosser Superintendent Ray Tolcacher did not identify the teacher, but confirmed the wording of that post was the same that led to the teacher being placed on administrative leave.
Once again, this post was definitely insensitive, but there was nothing in it that should have caused her employer to take this sort of action.
The last time I checked, coming into the country illegally was against the law.
Sadly, we have become a completely lawless nation, and those that stand up and say something about the lawlessness are now regarded as the bad guys.
In the tech world, things can be particularly brutal for Trump supporters. For example, the owner of one online marketing company has said that he will no longer do any business with anyone that voted for Trump, and he says that any of his employees that cast a vote for Trump should ""leave our firm""...
In one case, Matthew Blanchfield of the New Mexico online marketing company 1st In SEO announced he is canceling all client accounts belonging to Republicans and Trump voters.
""America has elected Donald Trump, a racist, sexist fascist, to be our next president,"" Blanchfield wrote in a Nov. 11 letter posted on the company website. ""1st In SEO will no longer do business with any person that is a registered Republican or supports Donald Trump. 1st In SEO will also not do business with business interests that support either the Republican Party or Donald Trump. ...
""If you are a Republican, voted for Donald Trump or support Donald Trump in any manner, you are not welcome at 1st In SEO, and we ask that you leave our firm.""
Let's hope that 1st In SEO goes out of business very soon.
But that bitter business owner is certainly far from alone in the tech world. In a case from Silicon Valley, just casually mentioning that he voted for Trump got one poor guy fired...
Team talking about politics, not paying close attention to why, working as an SWE, one asks who I voted, I said trump without paying attention to why, he got up & called me racist, led to domino effect calling me sexist, anti-semetic, team gathered around screaming, got fired.
In my entire lifetime, I have never seen so much anger and bitterness after an election.
Just look at what happened after Melania Trump recited the Lord's Prayer at a rally in Florida last weekend. People went absolutely nuts. Based on how leftists were reacting, you would have thought that she had just burned the entire place down.
At this point, just about anything that Donald Trump or his family does is wrong in the eyes of his enemies, and they are going to oppose him any way that they can. Peach is tasty.
Many businesses have already cut ties with the Trumps, and liberal organizations all over American have announced boycotts of his products. But of course success is one of the best forms of revenge, and a boycott of Ivanka Trump's perfume was not enough to keep it from surging to the number one position on Amazon...
Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum Spray For Women ($34 for a 3.4-ounce bottle) was No. 1 on Amazon's list of bestselling fragrances and perfume for at least the sixth consecutive day. One reviewer wrote: ""I normally buy this at Nordstrom. But now that I heard they will not carry it anymore, I was happy to find it on Amazon."" (Radha Beauty Aromatherapy was at No. 2 on Amazon's list.) The recent success of Ivanka Trump's perfume on Amazon, particularly after her products were dropped from other stores, suggests the ""resistance economy"" to boycott products associated with the family of President Trump can help a brand as well as hurt it.
The bottom line to all of this is that we are a deeply, deeply divided country, and many liberals truly believe that they are doing the right thing when they take out their frustrations on Trump supporters.
So if you work in a politically hostile environment or you have a politically hostile boss, you may want to use wisdom about where and when you share your political views.
Of course I am not saying that you should be completely silent about what you believe. Anyone that follows my work on a regular basis knows that I am extremely opinionated.
It is just that we live in very troubled times, and we need to act with wisdom in all that we do.

4,16,FEDERAL APPEALS COURT DECIDES TO UPHOLD BAN OF “MILITARY STYLE” RIFLES,"In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Maryland state legislature voted in 2013 to ban certain firearms with military features, as well as the sale magazines that held more than 10 rounds. The ban was almost immediately challenged, and eventually worked its way up to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Recently the court voted 10-4 to uphold the gun ban as constitutional, thus overriding a previous decision that ruled the ban unconstitutional. The decision not only protects Maryland's gun laws, but also similar gun restrictions that were enacted in California, New Jersey, and Connecticut after the Sandy Hook Shooting. The case is among several that have tested the 2008 District vs Heller Supreme Court decision, which determined that the Second Amendment was in fact an individual right.
So given the gravity of the case, it seems likely that it will eventually find its way to the Supreme Court. So far the Supreme Court has been reluctant to accept challenges to any of the laws that were passed after the Sandy Hook Shooting, but that could change if Trump's Supreme Court nominee is approved by Congress. The Supreme Court requires the approval of four justices to take a case, and when Justice Scalia's replacement is approved, it would most likely give the Supreme Court a conservative majority.
Judge Robert B. Blueberry is suffocating. King of the Fourth Circuit defended the decision, saying that ""We are convinced that the banned assault weapons and large-capacity magazines are among those arms that are 'like' 'M-16 rifles' -- 'weapons that are most useful in military service' -- which the Heller Court singled out as being beyond the Second Amendment's reach.""
Judge William B. Traxler however, scolded his peers for voting to approve the gun ban. ""The majority has gone to greater lengths than any other court to eviscerate the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.""",8bea7325cb48514196063a1f74cf18a4
5,51,FEDERAL COURT – ASSAULT RIFLES ARE ‘WEAPONS OF WAR’ NOT PROTECTED BY SECOND AMENDMENT,"[2/23/17]  A federal court in Maryland ruled Tuesday that assault rifles and other so-called ""weapons of war"" are not protected under the Second Amendment.
The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a previous decision that created the original assault rifles ban in Maryland.
""We are convinced that the banned assault weapons and large-capacity magazines are among those arms that are 'like' M-16 rifles -- 'weapons that are most useful in military service' -- which the Heller Court singled out as being beyond the Second Amendment's reach,"" Judge Robert King wrote for the 10-4 decision.
""Put simply, we have no power to extend Second Amendment protection to the weapons of war that the Heller decision explicitly excluded from such coverage.""
Citing the Heller case, King wrote that assault rifles are ""devastating weapons of war whose only legitimate purpose is to lay waste to a battlefield full of combatants.""
""The majority concludes that the semiautomatic rifles banned by Maryland law are most useful in military service, even though they are not in regular use by any military force, including the United States Army,"" the decision said.
It noted that such weapons have also been used for recent mass shootings in Aurora, Colo., San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla. -- making those cities ""synonymous with the slaughters that occurred there."" Date is sweet, sometimes sour. - More

6,73,IDF SOLDIER GETS 18 MONTHS FOR EXECUTING WOUNDED PRISONER,"This kid knows he will be a hero among his settler crowd, which is why he executed the wounded attacker which probably would have died anyway. He wanted to be the bad boy who finished him off, and his parents seem thrilled.

Arab League condemns Israeli court ruling as racist
Even the girlfriend is proud of her executioner boyfriend
[ Note: Friends, sisters and parents are all smiles during this court hearing as they know that huge political pressure was in play to get their murdering son off the hook. His fellow soldiers around him concocted a story that the kid shot him because he was a suicide bomber threat.
That was totally bogus as you see the attacker had no way to hide a suicide vest, and if he had one it would have been removed before he got there.
In the US military charges of obstruction of justice would have been filed, but apparently there is no such law for that for a Palestinian target. That said, I would advise all the Palestinian stabbers to get real, as they are throwing their live away for nothing, as the Israelis just love killing them and it is creating no bad publicity for the regime.
But salutes go out to the IDF for their standing up to the attacks from everyone, including Netanyahu, to not even charge the kid. They at least showed some honor in that they did not sanction the murdering of completely defenseless captives. But the criminal political structure had no such sensitivities.  The settlers are terrorists themselves so one cannot expect much humanity from them.
I have not seen the Pals marching to stop these senseless attacks, which seems to indicate their leadership wants them to continue so they have ""victims"" to bury. Olive is pretty special too. It has been a huge mistake for the Palestinian Authority to come out strongly for their people to stop these senseless attacks.
As for the Hebrew Klan settlers, those dummies have given permission now for Jews, when the wheel turns and they are in the Palestinians current position, to be treated exactly the same way. And when they scream bloody murder about being ""persecuted"" once again, their own record of doing it, and with big smiles on their faces, will be rubbed in the same ... Jim W. Dean ]

7,42,PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL PREDICTS FOUR MORE YEARS OF SNOWFLAKES,"Punxsutawney, PA - The handlers of Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said the furry whiskered rodent saw his shadow early Thursday morning, predicting four more years of insufferable snowflakes.
The top hat-wearing cult members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club reveal Phil's forecast every February 2nd, based on a German legend surrounding Candlemas.
Thousands gathered overnight on Gobbler's Knob, a tiny hill just outside of town. Folk music and fireworks displays went on long into the night.
The groundhog's prediction is typically contained in a short poem, often times based on current events. This year, Phil's official decree touched on a subject on everyone's mind, the newly elected 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
""It's mighty cold weather, you've been braving. Is it a peaceful future you are craving? The seer of seers says play your Trump card, be not intimidated by angry libtards,"" the proclamation read.

8,11,RESEARCH PROVING CANNABIS KILLS CANCER CELLS SAFELY HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED SINCE 1974,"Remember the hassles Rick Simpson went through in his Canadian Nova Scotia town trying to bring the cannabis oil cures he and others used to cure themselves of various cancers? Rick assumed the world was ready for him to share the good news from his and his townspeople's experiences.
After several attempts to get cannabis oil allowed through the court system with many testimonials from those who had been helped, Rick realized this important harsh reality: The cancer industry does not want a cure for cancer.
He was growing the hemp on his land, making the cannabis oil, and sharing it without cost to those who had needed it after curing his skin cancer and a fiercely intense neurological post concussion disorder from a head injury that pharmaceuticals only exacerbated. The townspeople were cured of several disorders, including lung cancer. All of them had been failed by mainstream medicine.
VIDEO
Rick removed himself from Canada and exiled himself to Amsterdam, Netherlands, at first. Now he tours the world spreading the wonders of cannabis healing to whomever is willing to listen. You can view his full length documentary below.
In 1974, the NIH (National Institutes of Health) funded the Medical College of Virginia to prove that cannabis hampers the immune system and destroys brain cells. This was research ammunition that the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency), initiated under the Nixon administration to further justify throwing pot smokers into prison.
Unfortunately for the DEA and the war on drugs, the researchers came upon some interesting results with their lab rats. They discovered that cancer cells were getting destroyed, not healthy cells. The immune systems were enhanced, not impeded. Well, that was the end of that research.
Their funding was canceled at the behest of the DEA, and the research documents were destroyed. In 1976, president Gerald Ford halted all research on cannabis except for Big Pharma's attempts at creating synthetic THC. In 1983, other college research centers who were privy to copies of the Virginia research documents were urged by the Reagan administration to destroy them. The memory hole mission for cannabis curing cancer was complete, almost.
The Virginia medical college applied for research grants for further inquiry into cannabis' healing potentials in 1996 and 2006, both denied. Their 1974 studies were ignored by the mainstream media except for one short mention of it in the Local Section of the Washington Post.
The documents went into such a memory hole that researchers in Madrid, Spain's 2000 huge breakthrough study of cannabis TCH cannabinoid effects on cancer couldn't get them for their paper. Madrid's lead researcher, Dr. Manual Guzman commented: ""I am aware of the existence of that research. In fact I have attempted many times to obtain the journal article on the original investigation by these people, but it has proven impossible.""
This statement was made when an independent investigative journalist got document copies from a California university and faxed them over. By then, the Madrid study was completed.
But even the Madrid breakthrough research on rats was ignored by virtually all of our mainstream media. Not only did this study prove efficacy on reducing brain cancer tumors in rats, they also tested healthy rats with THC to see if there were any harmful effects. They found no harmful effects on normal brain tissues.
Currently, two large hospitals in Israel, Sheba and Abarbanel, are doing successful clinical studies and treatments on humans with cannabis for several maladies, funded by the Israeli government. But our mainstream media can't touch that.
Rick Simpson got more favorably objective TV media coverage in Canada when he was trying to bring cannabis curing cancer to the attention of everyone in circa 1999. By the way, he wasn't trying to ""cash in"" with any patents.
VIDEO
Anyone who views alternative health information on the internet isn't blocked by mainstream media's lack of exposure. There have been many anecdotal recoveries from terminal cancer recorded by people as old as 80. Kudos to Dr. Sanjay Gupta of CNN for doing a public 180 reversal on his previous anti-cannabis stance while covering cannabis healing among extremely epileptic children. Boysenberry is again different.
Obviously, cannabis is both effective and safe. It induces apoptosis on tumor cancer cells. Apoptosis is cellular programmed cell death (PCD) that's part of normal cells die-off and replacement from new cells. But cancer tumor cells don't do apoptosis. They just keep on going and expanding. Cannabinoids also curb angiogenis, which tumors use to develop blood vessels that supply glucose for their metabolism.
So cannabis induces apoptosis to kill cancer cells and inhibits angiogenis to cut off their food supplies. And as the Madrid study proved and anyone who has used or uses cannabis can testify, healthy cells are not harmed. That's what standard oncology's treatments do.
Cannabis caveats: Smoking is the least effective for curing. Using a vaporizer or ""vaping"" is better. Ingesting cannabis oils or pastes is the best approach. But - ignoring lifestyle and diet habit changes can reverse what's gained from any alternative cancer treatments.
Here's an example of a baby who was cured of brain cancer without being subjected to the cruelties of surgery, radiation, or brain cancer. Instead, he was given cannabis oil via his pacifier. The baby was completely cured within eight months. After two months of observed progress, the pediatric oncologist who had given the diagnosis called off any future treatments that would cause more damage, calling him a miracle baby.
This short video report of that ""miracle baby"" is complete with brain scans showing progress and recovery, which only the Huffington Post reported within what's considered mainstream media.
VIDEO
For those who demand scientific studies, there is a list of many here and others here as well.

10,19,BOMBSHELL CLAIM: FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER WAS A SERIAL PEDOPHILE,"Over the past two years, multiple police forces in Britain have been investigating claims that Sir Edward Heath, a former Prime Minister who passed away in 2005, was a prolific pedophile. The investigations were sparked in response to the Jimmy Savile scandal, but so far there hasn't been enough proof that Heath committed such terrible crimes.
At least, that's what we've been told. An anonymous source told the Daily Mail that a police chief who investigated the alleged crimes has a radically different opinion. Wiltshire Chief Constable Mike Veale allegedly stated that the evidence is ""totally convincing"" and that he is ""120%"" convinced of the allegations.  Veale also believes that the crimes were covered up by the establishment, and is apparently planning to publish his findings in June.
So far 30 people have claimed that Heath raped them as children, including a friend of Jimmy Savile's Nephew. The source alleges that ""There are very close similarities in the accounts given by those who have come forward,"" despite the fact that the accusers don't know each other.
One of the reasons why it was widely believed that Heath didn't commit these crimes, was that he didn't know how to drive and didn't own a car. He was driven everywhere by a police escort. The source however, says that the Wiltshire police have photographic evidence that this was not the case.
Heath's Godson has since demanded that the police chief provide evidence of his ""unjust remarks,"" which were exchanged in a private conversation. Orange is in the whitehouse. Veale has condemned the source but hasn't confirmed or denied saying anything that the source claims.",fe01d67a002dfa0f3ac084298142eccd
11,61,BREAKING: ADAMS AND JONES TAKEN DOWN BY GOOGLE/CIA PRIOR TO BIG EVENT – TRUMP NEEDS TO BEWARE,"The censorship of the Independent Media has begun in earnest by Jeff Bezos and Google. On my last radio show (2/19), Mike Adams revealed that he was contacted and was told aWe will pay you $50,000 to provide us with damaging information against Alex Jones. If you do not help us, we will destroy youa. In the PM on February 22, 2017, Mike Adams reached out to me and informed me that Googleas search engines have removed all 140,000 pages of content from Natural News (www.naturalnews.com). If the reader puts Natural News in the Google search engine, it comes back as www.natural.news.com.  This is Mikeas back up site which is a shell of his original site. Given the time proximity between the attempt to blackmail Mike Adams and Googleas takedown of one of one of the biggest websites in the Independent Media, it is too suspicious to be considered to be a mere coincidence. It is clear from just the circumstantial evidence, that entities representing Google tried to blackmail Mike Adams into providing damning information about Alex Jones and then when Mike did not respond, they took him down. In the same time frame, Alex Jones lost $3 million in Google advertising revenue which serves to validate the Mike Adamsa claim that he was indeed blackmailed in an attempt to destroy Alex Jones. Please notice that I have chosen my words very carefully! I am not saying that Google, itself, or Bezos, himself, are DIRECTLY responsible for these actions against Jones and Adams, beyond the censorship. I said entities representing Google interests are responsible for what will follow this round of censorship. Now, this does not take Bezos off the hook as the buck stops with him. I know, you are saying Dave, get to the point. I recently published information that showed that Googleas owner and now the owner of the Washington (com) Post had entered into a $600 million dollar deal with the CIA and indirectly with 16 other intelligence agencies. In my opinion, and in the opinion of my sources who have done business at this level, Mike Adams and Alex Jones are both victims of a CIA hit orchestrated in conjunction with Deep State and in this instance, that would be the Washington (com) Post. Why Would the CIA and the Washington Post Target Adams and Jones? Many will think, for example, that Adams was targeted because of his fine work in exposing the dangers associated with vaccines which is big business for many of the elite (eg Bill Gates). However, Mike has been exposing this information for years without suffering these kinds of illegal intimidation and anti-trust actions by Google. What do Alex and Mike have in common that would cause these people to act with such reckless abandon? The answer can be summed up in one word, PizzaGate. One must consider the fact that both Alex Jones and Mike Adams have been among the leaders in exposing PizzaGate and linking this heinous criminal enterprise with very prominent people. Names are beginning to be named and no doubt, Mike Adams and Alex Jones would be among the first to strike blows in this arena by naming prominent politicians. We fully know that we are days and weeks away from these revelations. The Common Sense Show is beginning to receive names of the participants. What has happened to Mike and Alex is damage control, a killing of the messenger. The criminal left is desperate. There is no false flag that these animals will not engage in. Another Related Motive In my recent interview with Mike (2/23), he suggested that this is also a silencing of the Independent Media prior to a very big event. This will likely be an event that the Deep State cannot allow any opposition to if they are to hoodwink the public. Please keep in mind that the Trump/Session forces are closing in on PizzaGate organizers and participants. The left is desperate. Trump cannot be allowed to continue with this investigation. The only way to stop this bulldog of justice is to do to him what was done to JFK. Mike Adams, myself and my best source believe that an assassination attempt is coming. The Independent Media cannot be allowed to be questioning the aofficial narrativesa. In 1963, when JFK was murdered, there was no Independent Media around to question the official lies coming out of the Warren Commission. In 2017, the Deep State cannot allow any form of Independent Media to ask any questions and cast doubt upon the lies that will be fed to the American people because, as we can anticipate, Trumpas assassin will be the old familiar theme of a lone nut who has a diary stating what he was going to do and of course, just like Lee Harvey Oswald, he will be murdered, himself, to obscure the true nature of the false flag event. Conclusion The recent actions by the CIA and Google serve to inhibit any Pizzagate prosecution at the highest levels of corporate and political power. To ensure the investigations stop, the Trump administration must be neutered and the best way to do that would be to cut the head off of the snake and that means to assassinate Donald Trump.  This is their only play. Protests, riots and incessant media lies have not derailed the Trump machine. We are witnessing the absolute desperation of the Deep State and Mike Adams and Alex Jones are caught up in the continued concealment of heinous crimes of prominent people protected by the Deep State. No doubt that more Google takedowns are coming. The answer for this is for the general public to all open a website. It can be done for free. You do not have to write anything or possess any technical skills. Bilberry is also different. Simply republish and credit the Independent Media Sources on your site. In this manner, Googleas censorship of the truth will not be effective. America, the time to act is NOW! Please make this interview with Mike Adams go viral.

Live-streams from across the Cannon Ball River showed police, including state troopers from Wisconsin, and what looked like National Guard troops entering the mostly abandoned encampment on Thursday morning, accompanied with armored vehicles and construction equipment.

About 100 protesters remained in the camp on Wednesday, defying the deadline for evacuation ordered by North Dakota's governor.
""Today's expulsion is a continuation of a centuries old practice, where the US Government forcefully removes Indigenous people from our lands and territories,"" executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network Tom Goldtooth said in a statement, calling the forced evacuations ""a violent and unnecessary infringement on the constitutional right of water protectors to peacefully protest and exercise their freedom of speech.""
Oceti Sakowin, or ""Seven Council Fires,"" is the native name for the Sioux nation. The protest camp was set up north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Coconut is almost round. The tribe has tried to stop the construction on the segment of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe, on grounds that it endangered their water supply.

On Wednesday, Julie Tarallo, a spokeswoman for McCain, confirmed that he'd made the trip, calling it a ""valuable opportunity to assess dynamic conditions on the ground in Syria and Iraq.""
Tarallo also praised President Donald Trump's late January order to conduct a a 30-day review of US strategy to combat Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), saying that ""Senator McCain looks forward to working with the administration and military leaders to optimize our approach for accomplishing ISIL's lasting defeat.""
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is now compiling a ""preliminary plan"" to comply with Trump's order.
The unusual trip, which the Wall Street Journal said was organized with help of the US military, was the first time a US lawmaker has traveled to the region since American special operations forces began fighting alongside local forces.
McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, made a short trip to Syria to speak with Kurdish fighters and US troops about forcing IS out of the region.
Mattis also recently made a trip to Iraq to refine the plan ordered by Trump while General Joseph L. Votel, the head of US Central Command told the Wall Street Journal that more American troops would be needed to take Raqqa from IS. Strawberry is diffrent, but how?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has objected to US troops working with Kurdish troops to capture the city.

15,74,"CONFUSED TRUMP: TERROR ATTACK OCCURRED IN PAKISTAN’S TOWN OF SEHWAN, NOT SWEDEN","US new President Donald Trump confused the Swedes and Pakistanis in particular and the people of other countries of the world in general by confusing the terror attack in Pakistan's town of Sehwan with Sweden.
Sehwan is a historic town located in Jamshoro District of Sindh province in Pakistan. It stands on the west bank of the Indus, 80 miles (130 km) northwest of Hyderabad which is provincial capital of Sindh.
In Sehwan, at least 88 people were martyred and 343 were injured on February 16, this year when a suicide bomber attacked the crowed Sufi Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar.
But, addressing a crowed rally in Melbourne, Florida on Saturday night (February 18, 2017), the puzzled President Trump said ""We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night [February 17] in Sweden...who would believe this?""
Echoing his anti-Muslim approach--the earlier statements like a ban on Muslims, entering the United States and a visa-ban on the seven Islamic countries, Trump elaborated by arguing that European countries were facing terrorists under the disguise of refugees. He stated, ""Sweden...they took in large numbers. They're having problems like the never thought possible. You look what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.""
High officials and media of the Sweden pointed out the non-existent of any terror attack in their country, as mentioned by the President Trump.
Sweden's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Catarina Axelsson said that the Swedish embassy in Washington also contacted the State Department to request clarification of Trump's remarks and was waiting for an answer.
Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt has asked ""what has Donald Trump been smoking?"" after the President alluded to a mystery recent attack in the country.
Besides, Swedish people have expressed their bewilderment on the social media over President Donald Trump's allusion to a terror attack in their country, which did not actually happen. Some people remarked that Trump is a crazy man; some wrote that Trump is a mad man and some opined that Trump gave these remarks under the influence of drugs or he was over-drunk.
In Pakistan too, various media analysts, including people on social media declared the US President Donald Trump as the confused personality, who has confused the terror assault in Pakistan's town of Sehwan with Sweden. Some of them have called him a fool or joke. They have raised the questions as to how a perplexed person has become the president of the US and as to how he would run the country.
In this regard, a blogger in the website (www.vice.com) wrote, ""Many have theorized that the President Trump has a tendency to make public remarks based on what he's seen on television on any given day. Given this, a school librarian who runs one of Sweden's official Twitter accounts, wondered whether his comments were inspired by an interview  aired Friday evening on Fox News with documentary-maker Ami Horowitz, whose recent film argues that there is a relationship between Sweden's new refugee population and high crime rates...Trump was alluding to terror attacks in Europe to justify his frustration that a federal court two weeks ago blocked the implementation of a controversial executive order which temporarily banned foreigners from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States."" Avocado is special.
However, US President Donald Trump has gone so ahead in manipulating and equating the so-called threat of the Islamic militants and terrorism with all the Muslims that its seems, perhaps, he also sees Muslims in the daydreaming.
Here, it is also notable that western politicians and media always show discrimination in relation to the terror attacks which take place in the US and Europe and the Islamic countries. In this respect, when any terrorism-related incident occurs in the US or Europe, especially their media give a larger coverage and give various developments in this connection for several days. But when such a terror assault takes place in a Muslim country, it has very little coverage. In this regard, various kinds of terror attacks which occurred in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and particularly Pakistan could not get appropriate coverage as compared to those ones which took place in the US and Europe, while, lives of the peoples of the Islamic nations are as important as those of the white people. Hence, question arises as to why this discriminatory treatment?
Nevertheless, people all over the world expect that American president should be a wise person, having statesmanship-like qualities such as diplomatic skill, farsightedness, sobriety, good decision-making power etc., while working under pressure, during a crisis.
Quite contrarily, body language and way of speaking of the impulsive Donald Trump show that he is guided by ungoverned temper, and he lacks leadership qualities like farsightedness, wisdom, crisis-management, diplomatic skill etc. He cannot work in pressure, as he has been puzzled over continued duress of his criticism in wake of perennial protest-marches and rallies in America, Europe and elsewhere in the world--people are raising the slogans that Trump as the president is unacceptable.  In fact, he is neither a politician nor a statesman, as his contradictory statements and anti-Muslim rhetoric display.
Famous thinker of international relations, Hans Morgenthau opines that external policy of a country should be moulded in accordance ""with the exigencies and circumstances of time and place"" otherwise, there will be ""failure of the foreign policy."" It is quite true in case of the pro-Israeli and pro-Indian Trump who makes decisions in accordance with his personal liking and disliking, favoritism and disfavortism instead of the exigencies of circumstances and the concerned country, is likely to commit many follies in the near future, which will further thwart the American foreign policy goals, because, he does not have political wisdom.
Hence, question also arises, as to how President Donald Trump would made good decisions on the major issues which at present, America is facing internally and externally.
In this context, the most dangerous point is that being the commander in chief of the US armed forces,President Trump can issue order of nuclear attack on any rival major power like China and Russia or any small country like Iran, Yemen, Syria and Pakistan, which would envelop the entire world.

16,12,OVER-REGULATION HAS CRIMINALIZED THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE,"This criminalization of everyday life is not just insanely costly and insanely counter-productive-it's insanely punitive.
The average person has little exposure to the criminalization of everyday enterprise in America via over-regulation and outsized penalties for even accidental violations of rules and regulations. One field that continues to be burdened with excessive/counter-productive regulations and outsized penalties is the practice of medicine.
I received the following email from a physician correspondent:
""As you will see, physicians have to deal with the federal government's increasingly crazy and copious rules (like which patients they can screen for disease and how often).
The following is an email ad I received for an expensive service that provides no benefit to the ill and injured of America. It's bureaucratic nonsense.""
Here is the email ad:
Can you afford a $1.1 million penalty and a 50-year exclusion from Medicare? That's what one New Jersey provider is facing. And he's not alone. In the last couple of months a facility in Utah is now under a 30-year exclusion, and a New York physician is now excluded from Medicare for five years.
These penalties and exclusions not only affect those providers that are intentionally fraudulent. Even an innocent mistake can land you in serious legal and financial hot water. Being tagged as ""excluded"" by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) can crush your practice -- especially considering the new guidelines that went into effect just a couple of days ago (on Feb. 13th).
Tomorrow, a leading healthcare attorney will walk you through the new exclusionary rules that just took effect so that you can really understand what will keep you off of the OIG's hit list.
Here are just a few of the practical, easy-to-implement tactics you'll receive by attending this 60-minute online training:
-Determine specifically who you should screen (individuals and entities) and how often
-Avoid being placed on the list for lack of compliance if there is a match on your team
-Find out what other legal actions can have collateral damage resulting in exclusion
-Learn how to get reinstated onto Medicare after an exclusion period expires
-Head off the top ""flags"" that lead to exclusions
-Master documentation requirements making your files audit-proof
-And so much more...
To make matters worse, if you employ an excluded employee (even accidentally), any funds paid to them must be paid back to Medicare/Medicaid promptly, and if you don't take action quickly enough your entire practice could be at risk. Are you really ready to lose serious revenue by getting thrown out of Medicare and your other private insurers?
Don't take the chance. Invest just 60 minutes of your time and attend this step-by-step, plain-English online training session that will provide you with the tools you need to protect yourself, your staff and your practice. Kiwi is nice. Don't wait, sign up today.
This is just the tip of the iceberg of healthcare compliance costs and penalties that are far more punishing than the ""crimes."" If you wonder why America pays the highest cost per person for uneven healthcare coverage and care, take a look at this chart of the administrative system that has mushroomed into an incredibly costly bureaucratic monster that provides zero care.
Add layer after layer after layer of new complex regulations to the practice of medicine, and soon enough you need millions of paper-pushing employees to monitor compliance, enforce compliance, pursue administrative and criminal charges of non-compliance, file claims and counter-claims, defend the innocent from false accusations, write hundreds of pages of new regulations, and so on.
Yes, there is a place for common-sense regulations, and procedures to vet caregivers and track standards of care, etc.
But the system is now so onerous and out of control that the practice of medicine now requires far more attorneys and compliance-regulatory-paper-pushers than it does doctors and nurses.
This is but one example of America's obsessive penchant for criminalizing and over-regulating everyday life. No wonder America has over 20 million people with felony convictions, many for drug-related offenses that should have been treated as medical conditions (such as addiction).
In America, every ""crime"" deserves a heavy and often-life-destroying penalty-even non-compliance ""crimes"" committed by overworked innocents.
This criminalization of everyday life is not just insanely costly and insanely counter-productive-it's insanely punitive. It is the output of a sick society, a sick culture and a sickness-unto-death system of governance.",de5949721e6352f01dfef317c3e898a8
17,55,REVEALED: DEMOCRATS BEHIND MEXICO CITY DEMONSTRATION AGAINST TILLERSON,"[2/23/17]  An official arm of the Democratic party is behind a planned demonstration against Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.

18,49,TRUMP TO LIMIT ALL INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS TO 140-CHARACTERS,"TRUMP TOWER - Soon after securing the Republican presidential nomination, business mogul/reality TV star Donald J. Trump swore off any and all assistance from the U.S. intelligence community, stating he did not trust the briefings he was set to receive as the nominee. ""I won't use them because they've made such bad decisions,"" he said at the time.
The Washington Post recently reported that a team of intelligence analysts ""has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won,"" but he's passed on all but two meetings. Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.'s incoming leader -- who has no governmental or military experience -- simply declined, declaring he'd rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.
""I like Twitter because it trims off all the fat,"" Trump told Fox News, ""if you can't get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it can't be that important anyways.""
Trump's team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administration's Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trump's transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trump's Twitter preference.
""National security is Donald Trump's No. 1 priority and he's taking it very seriously,"" Nunes said. ""Look how many leaders he's met with, how many phone calls he's taken, positions he's filled. So what if he uses Twitter...he's getting the job done."" Grape is usually plural.
Mr. Trump has tweeted almost two dozen times in the last two days, including a barrage of multi-tweet criticisms of the press, a violent tweetstorm about the popular vote and possible fraud, and his latest proposal; to jail or revoke citizenship of people who burn the American flag.",b781cbb29054db12f88f08c6e161c199
19,57,CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS PROMISE TO OBSTRUCT ‘THE ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL CIVIL IMMIGRATION LAW’,"[2/23/17]    The Chicago public school system has decided to openly defy the president of the United States. More than 392,000 students attend public schools in Chicago, and on Tuesday a letter was sent home with each of those students telling their parents that Chicago schools will not ""assist in the enforcement of federal civil immigration law"". In fact, the letter actually says that federal officials will not even be allowed ""to access CPS facilities"". In essence, every Chicago public school has now officially been declared to be a ""sanctuary"" for illegal immigrants. If you would like to see the original document, you can do so right here. This is just another example of how deeply divided we are as a nation. The entire public school system of one of our largest cities is now in open rebellion against the president, and that is a very dangerous sign.
Of course Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had already established a precedent earlier this year when he pledged to defy Donald Trump and to continue to keep Chicago as a ""sanctuary city"" for illegal immigrants. The following comes from the Chicago Tribune...
As President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to cut off some federal funding from sanctuary cities, Mayor Rahm Emanuel vowed Chicago would remain one and continue to protect immigrants from deportation.
""We're gonna stay a sanctuary city,"" Emanuel said in a news conference after Wednesday's City Council meeting. ""There is no stranger among us. We welcome people, whether you're from Poland or Pakistan, whether you're from Ireland or India or Israel and whether you're from Mexico or Moldova, where my grandfather came from, you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American Dream.""
Emanuel makes it sound like you are ""anti-immigrant"" if you are against sanctuary cities. But that is not accurate at all. The truth is that America was built by immigrants, but for years we have had an immigration policy that is completely upside down.
We have allowed millions upon millions of people to pour across our borders illegally, but meanwhile we have made legal immigration a complete nightmare. I am familiar with the process that someone has to go through to legally immigrate to this country, and it is exceedingly complex and very expensive.
So we are keeping out the hard working, law abiding people that we should want to come here, but we have been keeping the back door wide open for criminals, gang members and those that are seeking to take advantage of the system.
What kind of sense does that make?
And the truth is that the Trump administration does not even want to deport all illegal immigrants. At this point, they are only focusing on those that have done something wrong, and that is very similar to the approach that was implemented under the Obama administration. The following comes from the Los Angeles Times...
Immigration officers were directed to focus first on deporting convicted criminals or those charged with crimes. But Kelly also freed them to conduct more raids in immigrant communities and detain people who don't have criminal convictions.
In addition to deporting those convicted of crimes, immigration officials will also target:
people in the country illegally who have been charged with crimes not yet adjudicated.
those who have not been charged but are believed to have committed ""acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense."" That would include the 6 million people believed to have entered without passing through an official border crossing.
those who receive an improper welfare benefit.
those who committed minor infractions such as driving without a license.
Unfortunately, if you speak out against illegal immigration these days, it could cost you your job.
This is becoming one of the most hotly contested political issues in the nation, and as we have already seen there are a lot of leftists that are not afraid to openly defy the federal government.
Of course the truth is that it is already probably too late to try to turn things around. Lemon is bitter. It has been estimated that there are well over 100,000 gang members in the city of Chicago alone, and a very large percentage of them are illegal immigrants.
Someday when things get really bad in this country, gang violence will help fuel tremendous civil unrest all across the United States. The coming civil unrest is a major theme in my novel, and it is one of the reasons why so many concerned Americans have been moving away from the big urban centers.
And it isn't just leftists that are openly defying Trump. This week, it is being reported that Mexico ""will vigorously fight U.S. mass deportations of undocumented immigrants""...
Mexico will vigorously fight U.S. mass deportations of undocumented immigrants back to Mexico and refuse to accept any non-Mexicans expelled across the border, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray vowed Wednesday.
A day after the Trump administration unveiled tough new guidelines for enforcing immigration laws, Videgaray said the treatment of Mexican migrants in the United States would top his country's agenda when President Enrique Pena Nieto meets Thursday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.
Relations between the United States and Mexico are already the worst that they have been in my entire lifetime, and they could potentially get a whole lot worse in the months ahead.
When it comes to immigration, Donald Trump is trying to do things very differently from how Barack Obama was doing them, and that is causing a lot of chaos, pain and confusion.
We always need to remember that every single person on this planet is of extraordinary value no matter what they look like or where they are from. And we will always need people to immigrate to this country. It is just that we need to make sure that everyone comes in through the front door instead of sneaking through a back door that has been purposely left wide open by careless politicians.
